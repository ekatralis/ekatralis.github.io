Hello! I am Vangelis Katralis and this is my personal blog. The main purpose of this is to document and discuss technology topics that interest me. These include:
- My homelab venture (to a large extent)
- Software Dev stuff
- Computers in general

This website is still work in progress and the end goal is to also add some professional information as well. In the meantime, if you are interested in my professional background, you can visit my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evangelos-katralis/) profile.
